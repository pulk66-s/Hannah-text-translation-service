### Other things

A subject can be other things that are not implemented yet. Like:

- Adjectival subject: It's made up of an adjective or adjectival group that describes the subject or gives it a particular characteristic. Example: "The sky is blue." Here, "blue" is an adjective that describes the subject "the sky".
- Subject adverbial: An adverb of place, time or manner. It indicates where, when or how the action of the verb is performed. Example: "Now we're leaving." In this sentence, "now" is an adverb of time that plays the role of subject.
- Infinitive subject: This consists of a verb in the infinitive and can represent a general or abstract action. Example: "Singing is his favorite pastime." Here, "sing" is an infinitive verb that functions as a subject, describing a general activity.
