# How the LSF works ? 

## Introduction

The LSF (Langue des Signes Française), is a language that is used by deaf people to communicate. It's a visual language that use the hands, the face and the body to communicate. It's a visual language but it has a grammar and a syntax. The LSF is a simplified version of the french language. It's not a word for word translation, it's a translation that is based on the french syntax tree.

## How is structured the LSF ?

- The French language is structured with 3 elements: `Subject, Verb and Complement`. The LSF needs to be fast and concise, so it looks like this: `Time, Place, Subject, Action`

- The French language has complex conjugation, the LSF has only 3 conjugations: `Present, Past, Future`. All the verbs are not conjugated, the time is indicated by another word.
    - Example:
        - 'J'ai mangé' -> 'Hier, moi manger'
        - 'Je mange' -> 'Moi manger'
        - 'Je mangerai' -> 'Demain, moi manger'
